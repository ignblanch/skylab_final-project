In order to run it locally you must have node and bower installed in your computer. 
Clone this repo and execute both ```npm install``` and ```bower install``` commands. Then execute ```npm run dev``` to run the server. Notice that in order to store and retrieve data a running mongodb daemon will be also necessary.

### Concept
This is a full stack web application designed using AngularJS in the front-end and NodeJS with Express in the back-end part. In order to store data the app uses a MongoDB database through Mongoose. You'll find the full list of npm modules used in this app as dependencies in the package.json and bower.json files.
The app intends to be a movies and TV shows aggregator and a source of reviews and conversations about popular media. The user is be able to search movies and tv shows, add them to a personal collection, rate, comment and review them, view other users' comments and reviews.
